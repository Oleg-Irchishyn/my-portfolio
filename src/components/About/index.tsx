          Outsource company or a product one is not a concern to me. I am looking for the company,
          that would give me an opportunity to grow and learn. The most important moment for me is
          communication within the development team and clients. Bad management causes a lot of
          issues, as well as bad code. Whether I will be coding websites or web services, all I want
          is to sharpen my skills and learn JS and ReactJS on real projects. The end goal is to
          become an outstanding developer, who will participate in difficult projects, which will
          bring profit to a company and satisfaction to me.
